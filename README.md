## A Vite mindset way

A fantastic application that allows you to press a button and see that it has been pressed.

I'm currently in negotiations to sell the idea to an investment fund to build a highly successful app.

I created this repo to have a project setup ready for building a React application based on Vite.

It includes an example of the **Component Renderer** pattern for building an internal component library.

## Getting Started

For the basic functionality of the application, you can directly run the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

And the Vite development environment is started.

## Usage

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result. 

## Stack

- Typescript
- Vite
- React
- Tailwind
- Unit(Jest + React testing library) testing

## Testing

For unit testing use the following command:

```bash
npm test -- --watch
```
